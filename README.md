# noughts-and-crosses
A game of noughts of crosses against an unbeatable AI.

The game is made with Pygame and the minimax algorithm is implemented. Every game should either result in a draw or a win for the AI.

I'd like to improve the game by resetting the board after each game and switching turns, instead of just quitting the game. Alpha-beta pruning could also be used to improve the minimax algorithm but it's already very quick.
